# MFP

This is a pet project I've been working on in my free time to (hopefully) bring my family's business out of the dark ages.

I've been learning HTML and CSS through Codecademy and know that I have a long way to go before making something professional and worthwhile.
I'm really proud of what I've made so far, but have so much to learn!

If you have any suggestions to make my code cleaner or more organized, please let me know. I want to be as good as I can be, coding has been a fun journey and I want to learn as much as possible!
